## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public Issue for security exploits.

If you find a security vulnerability (e.g., a skill that bypasses the "Authorized Use Only" check or executes malicious code without warning):

1. Email: `security@antigravity.dev` (Placeholder)
2. Or open a **Private Advisory** on this repository.

## Offensive Skills Policy

Please read our [Security Guardrails](docs/SECURITY_GUARDRAILS.md).
All offensive skills are strictly for **authorized educational and professional use only**.
